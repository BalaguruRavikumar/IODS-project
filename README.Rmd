## About the course:
The **Introduction to Open Data Science** is an excellent initative for graduate students like myself to explore the base aspects of reporducible research. The course through various workshop excercises faciliaties *hands-on* data anaylsis frameworks to explore and review. Further the peer-review process accompanied with every excercise would aid in understanding the excercise in a grave manner.
